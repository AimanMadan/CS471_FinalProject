The project develops a machine learning model to classify glioma grades using MRI-derived radiomic features. It addresses class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE, weighted classes, and data augmentation. Gradient Boosting achieved the best F1-score (98%), enhancing accuracy for critical medical diagnoses.
